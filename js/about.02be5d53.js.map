The second is whether these books when translated\r\n                    can be perceived as sociological artifacts that reflect the\r\n                    state of Arab countries in a certain time space by the\r\n                    reader, rather than a work of fiction, which they are most\r\n                    of the time.\r\n                  </v-card-text>\r\n                  <v-card-text>\r\n                    The initial phase of data collection has been completed.\r\n                    That allowed for this network visualization to be the next\r\n                    step of development as it clearly shows the relationship\r\n                    between entities involved in the translation process.
